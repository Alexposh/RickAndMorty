The app is costructed to fetch data from https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql and shows Rick and Morty characters with a list on the left side and a highlighted item on the right.
Clicking on a list item changes the element that is on the right. Searching with "Rick" or "Morty"  a letter like "b"or even empty string "" should show the results.  

To use it on your device:

- Download the .zip or clone the repository.
- Run "npm install"
- Run "npm install react-router-dom"
- Run "npm install @apollo/client graphql"
- Run "npm run dev"
- List should be populated and items in the list should be available.

The app has React Router but it is not crucial for the actual functionality. It enables further development for more pages or segments.
